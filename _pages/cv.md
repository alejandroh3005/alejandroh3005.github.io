Education
======
* **University of Washington**, Seattle WA
  * M.S. in Biostatistics, 2025
  * Capstone Pathway

* **California State Polytechnic University**, Pomona CA
  * B.S. in Computer Science, 2023
  * Statistics Minor
  * Summa Cum Laude

Experience
======

* 2025: **Statistician** ▪ 3 months
  * University of Washington
  * _Prevalence of Unsheltered Homelessness across King County, WA_: Collaboration with a social scientist to estimate the prevalence of unsheltered homelessness within Washington state. Leveraged novel survey methodology with classic spatial analysis for area-level estimation from small sample sizes. Compared performance of direct estimators to global and local smoothing spatial models.
  * Supervisor: Zack Almquist, PhD

* 2024-25: **Principal Investigator** ▪ 6 months
  * Seattle Children’s Hospital
  * _Trends of Mental Health among Substance-Related Pediatric Hospitalizations_: Collaborated with a primary care pediatrician and principal data scientist to analyze recent trends in pediatric health. Co-authored a Statistical Analysis Plan of advanced statistical techniques for clustered longitudinal data (e.g., mixed-effect models and interrupted time-series analysis) and conducted comparative analysis between patient demographics. Facilated team discussion and decision-making, spearheaded scientific approach and project planning.
  * Supervisor: Dwight Barry, PhD
 
* 2024: **Research Assistant** ▪ 7 months
  * The Mountain-Whisper-Light
  * _Race and Wrongful Conviction in the United States_: Collaborated with a professional statistician to study factors that contribute to wrongful convictions in the US. Investigated factors through data visualization and (multiple nonlinear) regression of penalty-related outcomes. Analyzed association of race and alleged crime through hypothesis testing of statistical interaction.
  * Supervisor: Nayak Polissar, PhD

* 2023-24: **Statistician** ▪ 7 months
  * Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington
  * _Survey on Social Climate_: Conducted a departmental survey on social climate, summarized qualitative and quantitative data in a comprehensive report and presented findings to administrators. Results brought attention to minority student experience and lead to productive community workshops on cultural diversity and resources guiding student access of mental health services.
  * Supervisor: Minh Vo
 
* 2022-23: **Research Assistant** ▪ 9 months
  * California State Polytechnic University 
  * _Parallel Machine Learning for Climate Suitability_: Studied crop suitability modeling and precision agriculture through a machine learning model designed to maximize informational entropy, known as MaxEnt. I designed parallel implementations of the MaxEnt algorithm to estimate suitable locations for popular crops in California, given raster maps of climate data. I presented our progress at Cal Poly Pomona's College of Science symposium and the 2022 Southern California Conferences of Undergraduate Research (SCCUR). Developed a specialized iterative learning model with parallel computing design for a unique agriculture classification problem, implemented with GIS software and high-performance computing Python scripts.
  * Supervisor: John Korah, PhD
 
* 2022-23: **Teaching Assistant** ▪ 9 months
  * California State Polytechnic University 
  * _Introduction to Statistics_: Tutored over 36 undergraduates in introductory statistics, fostering improved comprehension and performance; collaborated with professors to address student needs, offered actionable feedback on curriculum and teaching strategy.
  * Supervisor: Jimmy Risk, PhD
  
Skills
======
* Clever number crunching
  * Models for regression and classification that either emphasize inference (e.g., logistic regression) or optimization (e.g., random forest).
  * Methods for handling various real-world limitations that complicate data (e.g., effects of clustering/time/space, informative censoring and unmeasured confounders)
* Talking to computers
  * Languages: R, SAS, Python, Java
  * Data management: SQL, Power BI
  * Computing: computer networks and parallel architecture
* Talking to people
  * Strong public speaking skills with the ability to communicate in a compelling, persuasive and professional manner
* Graphic design
  * Guiding principles of designing visuals and messaging for a particular audience
  * Strong sense to make information accessible, engaging and honest

Service and leadership
======

* 2020: **Project Leader, Conference Mentor** ▪ 1 year, 2 months
  * Cal Poly Pomona sheCodes 
  * _The_: Introduced two teams of undergraduate peers to AI and ML algorithms in weekly meetings over 8 weeks; mentees completed and presented Python projects. Co-advised middle/high school girls as they learned coding basics and shared my enthusiasm/journey and encouraged them to join STEM careers.
  * Supervisor: Stephanie De Leon
