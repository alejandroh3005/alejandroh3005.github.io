Experience
======

* 2025: **Statistician** ▪ 3 months
  * University of Washington
  * _Prevalence of Unsheltered Homelessness across King County, WA_: Collaboration with a social scientist to estimate the prevalence of unsheltered homelessness within Washington state. Leveraged novel survey methodology with classic spatial analysis for area-level estimation from small sample sizes. Compared performance of direct estimators to global and local smoothing spatial models.
  * Supervisor: Zack Almquist, PhD

* 2024-25: **Principal Investigator** ▪ 6 months
  * Seattle Children’s Hospital
  * _Trends of Mental Health among Substance-Related Pediatric Hospitalizations_: Collaborated with a primary care pediatrician and principal data scientist to analyze recent trends in pediatric health. Co-authored a Statistical Analysis Plan of advanced statistical techniques for clustered longitudinal data (e.g., mixed-effect models and interrupted time-series analysis) and conducted comparative analysis between patient demographics. Facilated team discussion and decision-making, spearheaded scientific approach and project planning.
  * Supervisor: Dwight Barry, PhD
 
* 2024: **Research Assistant** ▪ 7 months
  * The Mountain-Whisper-Light
  * _Race and Wrongful Conviction in the United States_: Collaborated with a professional statistician to study factors that contribute to wrongful convictions in the US. Investigated factors through data visualization and (multiple nonlinear) regression of penalty-related outcomes. Analyzed association of race and alleged crime through hypothesis testing of statistical interaction.
  * Supervisor: Nayak Polissar, PhD

* 2023-24: **Statistician** ▪ 7 months
  * Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington
  * _Survey on Social Climate_: Conducted a departmental survey on social climate, summarized qualitative and quantitative data in a comprehensive report and presented findings to administrators. Results brought attention to minority student experience and lead to productive community workshops on cultural diversity and resources guiding student access of mental health services.
  * Supervisor: Minh Vo
 
* 2022-23: **Research Assistant** ▪ 9 months
  * California State Polytechnic University 
  * _Parallel Machine Learning for Climate Suitability_: Developed a specialized iterative learning model with parallel computing design for a unique agriculture classification problem, implemented with GIS software and high-performance computing Python scripts. Oral and poster presentations at two undergraduate research symposiums to demonstrate technical proficiency.
  * Supervisor: John Korah, PhD
 
* 2022-23: **Teaching Assistant** ▪ 9 months
  * California State Polytechnic University 
  * _Introduction to Statistics_: Tutored over 36 undergraduates in introductory statistics, fostering improved comprehension and performance; collaborated with professors to address student needs, offered actionable feedback on curriculum and teaching strategy..
  * Supervisor: The, PhD

  * _The_: The.
  * Supervisor: The, PhD




* Summer 2024: **Research Assistant** ▪ 7 months
  * The Mountain-Whisper-Light
  * Duties included: In collaboration with a professional statistician, I conducted independent research relating to the Innocence Project and the incarceration of innocent people in the United States. Studying the National Registry of Exonerations, my focus was on identifying prevalent intersectional profiles of race, age at conviction, and type of crime.
  * Supervisor: Nayak Polissar, PhD

* Autumn 2023: **Committee Assistant** ▪ 8 months
  * Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington
  * Duties included: Conducted a departmental survey on social climate, authored a comprehensive report and presented findings to administrators. The results brought attention to experiences of minority students and lead to productive community workshops on cultural diversity and resources guiding student access of mental health services.
  * Supervisor: Minh Vo

* Autumn 2022: **Teaching Assistant** ▪ 9 months
  * Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Cal Poly Pomona
  * Duties included: Tutored over 36 undergraduates in introductory statistics, fostering improved comprehension and performance; collaborated with professors to address student needs, offering actionable feedback on curriculum and teaching strategy.
  * Supervisor: Jimmy Risk, PhD
 
* Spring 2022: **Research Assistant** ▪ 1 year 3 months
  * Department of Computer Science, Cal Poly Pomona
  * Duties included: Studied crop suitability modeling and precision agriculture through a machine learning model designed to maximize informational entropy, known as MaxEnt. I designed parallel implementations of the MaxEnt algorithm to estimate suitable locations for popular crops in California, given raster maps of climate data.I presented our progress at Cal Poly Pomona's College of Science symposium and the 2022 Southern California Conferences of Undergraduate Research (SCCUR)..
