I am a biostatistician and graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a background in software engineering and a deep passion for public health. Although I love leveraging clever methods to investigate data and uncover its underlying story, I'm really driven by the people behind the numbers. I believe good analysis is honest, clear, and rooted in real-world impact.

I look forward to entering the industry---applied statistics is fabulous work! I love to encounter new problems and learn new science, and I love to help people.

# 🌱 where I come from:

Halfway through my undergraduate Computer Science degree, I had grown distant from the algorithms and architecture. I liked programming and recognized CS applications were important, but imagining a future as a software engineer felt like a poor fit. I wanted to lean into Data Science and peek behind the curtain of machine learning, so I began a Statistics minor. Those early semesters were very humbling, but class kept me engaged and peers motivated me as I grew a sense of belonging in their classrooms. The small Mathematics and Statistics department welcomed me into their community and the relationships I began in that period became very formative, especially that with Dr. Jimmy Risk. I was learning all the clever ways people bridge theory and application, what is lost and gained along the way, and how to bring meaningful insights into decision-making that impacts people's lives. I felt I had found my place in applied statistics and had been shown there was so much more. Toward graduation, someone suggested applying to a Biostatistics graduate program. After Googling "Biostatistics" and seeking reassurance from my professors, I decided to give it a shot!

# 🌳 where I am:

Graduate school has not just been an opportunity to gain technical skill, but to deepen my understanding of myself and my place in the world. I feel incredibly grateful to study in this renowned program, be exposed to brilliant public health work, and see directly where I contribute to it. It has been so rewarding to master what I consider to be the most challenging part of this field: making something useful when it is on some level wrong. I have totally transformed as a student and as a person since completing my undergraduate degree, bright and green.

# 🌟 where I'm going:

My future plans are to work! Since I started this program, I have become very familiar with what I am capable of. My passion is the application of statistics in public health to drive evidence-based decisions and contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. I look forward to entering the industry---applied statistics is fabulous work! I love to see new problems and learn lots of science, and I love to help people. Thoughtful, honest science has been my goal from the beginning and this experience has been an integral part of that achievement.
