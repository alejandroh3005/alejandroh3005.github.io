If you are wanting to discover who I am and what I do, you've come to the right place! 

Professionally, I am a biostatistician with excellent people skills and a background in software engineering. I have expertise with data visualization, statistical modeling, project management, public speaking, and software documentation in collaborative settings. My passion is the application of statistics in public health to drive evidence-based decisions and contribute to improved healthcare outcomes.

Personally, I am a bright and curious person who loves to learn new science and help people. I love listening to music and spending time with my partner and writing mediocre poetry about her. I love calling my family!

üå± where I come from:
======

Halfway through my undergraduate Computer Science degree, I had grown distant from the algorithms and architecture. I liked programming and recognized CS applications were important, but imagining a future as a software engineer felt like a poor fit. I wanted to lean into Data Science and peek behind the curtain of machine learning, so I began a Statistics minor. Those early semesters were very humbling, but class kept me engaged and peers motivated me as I grew a sense of belonging in their classrooms. The small Mathematics and Statistics department welcomed me into their community and the relationships I began in that period became very formative, especially that with Dr. Jimmy Risk. I was learning all the clever ways people bridge theory and application, what is lost and gained along the way, and how to bring meaningful insights into decision-making that impacts people's lives. I felt I had found my place in applied statistics and had been shown there was so much more. Toward graduation, someone suggested applying to a Biostatistics graduate program. After Googling "Biostatistics" and seeking reassurance from my professors, I decided to give it a shot!

üå≥ where I am:
======

Graduate school has not just been an opportunity to gain technical skill, but to deepen my understanding of myself and my place in the world. I feel incredibly grateful to study in this renowned program, be exposed to brilliant public health work, and see directly where I contribute to it. It has been so rewarding to master what I consider to be the most challenging part of this field: making something useful when it is on some level wrong. I have totally transformed as a student and as a person since completing my undergraduate degree, bright and green.


üåü where I'm going:

My future plans are to work! Since I started this program, I have become very familiar with what I am capable of. My passion is the application of statistics in public health to drive evidence-based decisions and contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. I look forward to entering the industry‚Äîapplied statistics is fabulous work! I love to see new problems and learn lots of science, and I love to help people. Thoughtful, honest science has been my goal from the beginning and this experience has been an integral part of that achievement.
