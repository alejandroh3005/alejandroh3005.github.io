# Statistician, data analyst, programmer and quantitative scientist.

I am a biostatistician and graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a background in software engineering and a deep passion for public health. Although my expertise is leveraging clever methods to investigate data and uncover its underlying story, I’m really driven by the people behind the numbers. I believe good analysis is honest, clear, and rooted in real-world impact. I look forward to entering the industry—applied statistics is fabulous work! I love to encounter new problems and learn new science, and I love to help people.
