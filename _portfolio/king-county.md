Collaboration with a social scientist to estimate the prevalence of unsheltered homelessness within Washington state. We leveraged novel survey methodology with classic spatial analysis for area-level estimation from small sample sizes. I compared performance of direct estimators to global and local smoothing spatial models.

We are preparing a publication of this work for submission to the Nature Cities journal.
