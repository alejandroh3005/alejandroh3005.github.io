# Multidisplinary Analysis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Risk
I collaborated with three epidemiologists to analyze risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) from a case-control study. I translated scientific aims to statistical methods (e.g., logistic regression), implemented data analysis in R, performed hypothesis testing, contributed to post-hoc discussion, and authored relevant sections of a summary report.
