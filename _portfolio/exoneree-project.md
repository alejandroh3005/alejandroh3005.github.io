In collaboration with professional statistician [Nayak Pollisar, PhD](https://www.mwlight.com/#about-us) and fellow graduate [Cindy Elder, MS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindy-elder-0600a7293/), I studied factors that contribute the wrongful convictions in the United States. 
My work heavily consisted of producing data visualizations/summaries and multiple nonlinear regression of penalty-related outcomes. 
An outstanding achievement of this project was my measure of interrelated association between race and alleged crime through hypothesis testing of statistical interaction.
