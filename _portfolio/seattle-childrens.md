In ongoing sponsorship from primary care pediatrician 
[Alexis Ball, MD, MPP](https://www.peds.uw.edu/directory/alexis_ball/2627) 
and principal data scientist 
[Dwight Barry, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwight-barry) 
my team of fellow graduates are working to describe recent trends in pediatric health. 

Alongside 
[Lingfei “Ellen” Jiang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/ellen-jiang), 
[Shizhao “Joshua” Yang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/joshua-yang),
and
[Ruyue “Jasmine” Wang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/ruyue-wang),
I co-authored a Statistical Analysis Plan of advanced statistical techniques for clustered longitudinal data (e.g., generalized estimating equations) and conducted comparative analysis between patient demographics.
An outstanding achievement was my facilitating team discussion and decision-making, and spearheading scientific approaches and project planning. 

Project will be completed March 2025.
