In sponsorship from primary care pediatrician [Alexis Ball, MD,
MPP](https://www.peds.uw.edu/directory/alexis_ball/2627) and principal
data scientist [Dwight Barry,
PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwight-barry) my team of fellow
graduates described and modeled recent trends in pediatric health.

Alongside [Lingfei "Ellen"
Jiang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/ellen-jiang), [Shizhao
"Joshua" Yang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/joshua-yang)
and [Ruyue "Jasmine"
Wang](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/ruyue-wang), I
co-authored a Statistical Analysis Plan of advanced statistical
techniques for clustered longitudinal data (e.g., mixed-effect models
and interrupted time-series analysis) and conducted comparative analysis
between patient demographics. An outstanding achievement was my
facilitating team discussion and decision-making, and spearheading
scientific approaches and project planning.
